## Project Summary
This is a project extension from a paired programming exercise.

In this project version I created a Bitmap generator capable of performing three image mutations.  This application runs in the terminal, and it accepts three arguments of an input bitmap image, a file path for the new image, and one of three image mutation types.

Overall I created the image mutations to work well with the supplied mario bitmap image supplied in this repo.  While this bitmap generator will work with any bitmap files, I experimented and exercised with the mario image.

### Accepted Image Mutations
There are three different image mutations availble:
1. cyclopisfyMario :
  Gives Mario two heads.  

2. mirrorMario:
  Mirros Mario along the x-axis.
  
3. luigifyMario :
  Turns Mario's red shirt into green so it looks like Luigi.
